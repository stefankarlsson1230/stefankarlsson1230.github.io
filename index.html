        I studied at Lexicon from march 2024 until january of 2025. The curricula was mostly focused on C# and .NET / ASP.NET, but we also got some insights
        into frontend, databases and Azure.<br><br>
        <em>I'm currently reworking all projects and assignments. They will be displayed on this page as they are completed.</em>

          <h3>The Test Portal</h3>
          <p>My final project at Lexicon</p>
          <p>The school was still giving exams on paper, and to fix this issue we created a webb-app for both teachers and students. Teachers can create 
            and schedule tests, while students can log in, take tests and immediately see their results. Everything is saved in a database. </p>
          <p>We were two people working on this project; my colleague worked on the identity/authorization part of the project, while I did the rest.</p>
          <p>The application are currently used in production at Lexicon.</p>
          <p>Fullstack ASP.NET with entity framework</p>
